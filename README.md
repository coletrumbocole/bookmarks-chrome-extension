An extension that does almost exactly the same thing that bookmarking already does. But I can share it across chrome users.

Hopefully I add these features in the future:
1 - It backs up to my airtable.
2 - It has a checkbox for read items, to do list for unread.
3 - It integrates with my study system - saving google searches, saving citation/bibliographic info, tells me what areas of study need attention, allows annotation of a webpage, 
4 - It has a nice appearance - with thumbnail pics for each link, stuff like that.
5 - Lets me search by keywords to retrieve bookmarks I might have misplaced or forgotten.
6 - Generate quizlet set.
7 - Cures cancer.
